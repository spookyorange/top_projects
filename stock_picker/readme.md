Stock Picker


What is it ? 


=> give our stock picker random numbers which has indexes as days(starts from 0 and no you dont have to say anything about indexes its just for information)


=> stock picker selects the most profitable days to buy and sell (after terminating code [x, y] => x means buying day(0 today, 1 is next etc), y means selling day)


How it works ?


=> open stock_picker.rb ruby file


=> change stock_picker([]) at the bottom to stock_picker([1, 3, 5, 4, 23, 1521252(or things like that)])


=> open terminal and type ruby stock_picker.rb


=> enjoy !
