What it does ?

=> it tells us about how many times a word / words appeared in a dictionary(which is a parameter you can see in the "How to use it ?" section) 


How to use it ?

=> it takes 2 parameters : 1) Dictionary(["your content", "your second content"...]), which has all the unordered things inside


=> and 2) my_words which is a string ("your content") takes the words you want to find how many times it appears in the dictionary


=> download file and change the dictionary (at the top)(parameter 1) and the sub_strings("", dictionary)'s "" part(parameter 2)


=> open your terminal and type ruby sub_strings.rb and be amazed
